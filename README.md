# Forecasting-Tornadoes

This repository [^quick_note] contains statistical models for forecasting tornadoes.

[^quick_note]: Lightweight repositories for forecasting and inference, such as this one (usually created by @AFg6K7h4fhy2), are typically made as experimental test units for tackling Metaculus questions with statistical modeling or for the sake of the collaborators' understanding of statistical methods.

If you want to collaborate and create a model, please clone this repository

`git clone git@github.com:AFg6K7h4fhy2/Forecasting-Tornadoes.git`

and then create a new branch with your model. If you have feedback for the authors of this repository, please [make an issue](https://github.com/AFg6K7h4fhy2/Forecasting-Tornadoes/issues).

This repository uses `poetry` for dependency management. To install poetry, you can run `pipx install poetry` [^poetry].
