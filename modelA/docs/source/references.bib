% Multi-compartment models have been playing a central role in modeling infectious disease dynamics since the early 20th century. They are a class of mathematical models widely used for describing the mechanism of an evolving epidemic. Integrated with certain sampling schemes, such mechanistic models can be applied to analyze public health surveillance data, such as assessing the effectiveness of preventive measures (e.g., social distancing and quarantine) and forecasting disease spread patterns. This review begins with a nationwide macro mechanis- tic model and related statistical analyses, including model specification, estimation, inference and prediction. Then, it presents a community-level micro model that enables high-resolution analyses of regional surveillance data to provide current and future risk information useful for local government and residents to make decisions on reopenings of local business and personal travels. R software and scripts are provided whenever appropriate to illustrate the numerical detail of algorithms and calculations. The COVID-19 pandemic surveillance data from the state of Michigan are used for the illustration throughout this paper
